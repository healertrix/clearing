"""How a campaign is run and settled (docs/DISCUSSION.md, G6 and G9 to G16).

  * Rungs per segment (category, platform, tier, format) from that segment's past posts only:
    rung 1 is reached by QUALIFY_REACH of them, each next rung by STEP_CHANCE of those on the one
    below. A segment with no past posts is a cold start: no rungs until the 25% mark, then rungs
    built from the campaign's own posts, rebuilt at 50% and 75% (up or down), final at 75%.
  * Fair Reach at the 25/50/75% marks: per group (category, format), each post judged against the
    first rung for its age. If both the share of posts and the share of creators on track are clearly
    below QUALIFY_REACH, every rung of the group shrinks by the Nash factor sqrt(score 80% reach).
    Only down, never up.
  * Fraud: hold a post if its drop after the peak is extreme, or sharp *and* it is far above the
    creator's usual; a peak on the last day is judged on size alone. Held posts are reviewed within
    REVIEW_DAYS; proven fraud mints nothing, cleared posts count in full.
  * Price: every validated view is a coin in the price; creators are paid only for the coins at the
    rung each post reached; everything priced but not paid is refunded to the brand.
    pool = budget / coins; below the market reference the whole budget is split; above it the price
    is the Nash split sqrt(pool x reference) and the rest is refunded.
